Tasks

0. Remove Characters from String
File: 0-no_c.py

Implement a function no_c(my_string) that removes all occurrences of characters 'c' and 'C' from a given string. 
The function should not use any built-in replace function and should return the modified string.

1. Print Matrix of Integers
File: 1-print_matrix_integer.py

Implement a function print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]]) that prints a matrix of integers in a specific format. 
The function should take a list of lists as input and print each element of the matrix using the str.format() method.

2. Return Length and First Character in Tuple
File: 2-multiple_returns.py

Implement a function multiple_returns(sentence) that takes a string as input and returns a tuple containing the length of the string and its first character. 
If the string is empty, the first character in the tuple should be None.
